Write two commands. The first one creates directories server0, server1, ..... server9, and the second changes their permissions: user has full access, group can only see what is in the dir, but can't create or delete files, others has no rights
Tip: Use shell expansions
#################### ANSWER ####################
mkdir server{0..9}
chmod 750 server{0..9}
